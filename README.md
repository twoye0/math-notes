# Math Notes

This repository contains mathematical notes
compiled during my undergraduate studies
as a Financial Mathematics major.

The notes focus on organizing key concepts
from mathematics courses and
connecting them to applications in financial problems.

Rather than formal proofs,
the emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding
and interpretation from an applied perspective.
